<h1 align="center">Black Jack</h1> 

<p align="center">
I decided to recreate the world wide known card game Black Jack with Python. I've created a very nice user interface that allows a clear decision whether to hit or stand. I hope you enjoy this CPU vs End-User type setup card game. Enjoy!

## Rules
In Blackjack there are two players, the CPU will be the dealer and you will be the other player. There will be a bet amount placed and you either win or lose that amount of chips. During each segment, you either get to hit or stand. If you hit, so does the dealer and you will both receive a face up card. The card values are their corresponding numbers, face cards are worth 10, and aces are either a 11 or 1 to your advantages. If you stand, you will no longer draw cards. If you go over the value 21 in total cards you lose. The player who comes closest to 21 or gets 21 without going over wins. Good luck!
